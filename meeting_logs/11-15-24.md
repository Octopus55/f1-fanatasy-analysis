+ Meeting Purpose: Discuss progress 11/15/24
+ Date and Time: 13:00:00-14:00:00 2024-11-15
+ Team members in attendance:
  + member 1: Nick Pfeifer
  + member 2: Josh Lee

## Agenda Items

+ item 1: Data window training parameterization
  + discussed interesting features of training over variable windows
  + Nick completed construction of the parameterized function with F1 and acc. 
    results to report for each value of $n$ (averaged over all races for a 
    given window)

## Key Responses on Agenda Items

+ response 1: 
  + Window functionality works well - need to update to optimize for 
    feature selection - whole point of our method is that the best features
    to choose change over different data windows and so we want to 
    include different features over time
+ response 2
  + decision trees may be better suited to handle interactions than 
    logistic regression models (implicit interaction encoding)

## Questions Discussed

> identify areas of high importance which require follow-up

+ question 1
+ question 2

## Action Items and Next Steps

+ Action item 1:
  + JOSH: finish getting 2024 data together [DONE]
+ Action item 2:
  + JOSH: forward selection procedure (automatic feature selection) for 
    (make it to return a list of features - input should be the entire 
    training data window of interest)
+ Action item 3:
  + NICK: decision tree, xgboosting, random forest
+ Action item 4:
  + JOSH: Add a prev points feature to indicate the proportion of all
    points allocated to a given driver
