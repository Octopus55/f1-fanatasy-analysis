# F1 Podium Finisher Prediction

F1 is the pinnacle of motorsport. It features the fastest drivers in the world, 
driving the fastest cars ever built, on the most storied and beloved 
tracks around world. Not only is F1 itself a competitive sport, but so is the 
practice of attempting to predict its associated outcomes. Just like any 
popular sport, F1 boasts high volume betting markets where highly accurate
outcome predictions can lead to a major advantage, and better returns. 
In addition, F1 officially sponsors fantasy team selection, with some leagues
offering cash prizes and other incentives. 

Needless to say, there is a lot riding on predicting who wins any given race, 
or aces qualifying on a given weekend. However, if it were so easy, then everyone
would be making money. Although F1 outcomes for the 2022 and 2023 season were 
"boring" for many viewers (Max Verstappen won 19 out of 21 races in 2023), there
was still a great deal of variability in who (else) would end up on the podium. 
This year takes this type of variability to a new extreme. Although McLaren 
appears to have the strongest overall package over the course of the season, 
recent races have marked a resurgence for Ferrari who had won earlier in the 
season as well. Moreover, Mercedes and Red Bull have also experienced winning runs 
of 3 or more races over the course of the season. 

Despite the high variance of the problem, machine learning models have 
proved quite effective at modeling the outcome prediction problem.

However, there are several critical issues with these prior approaches:

1. Failure to correctly model point valuations for drivers and constructors
2. Prior methods have not successfully incorporated track features for meaningful 
   track-oriented prediction
3. Data window limitations

<!--NICK: add note on your contributions for the proposal (questions)-->

Although each of these are important issues, the last is arguably the most 
significant. In prior work, data windows 

## Problem Description

<!--BOTH, multi-pronged problem-->

The problem we would like to tackle is accurately predicting the probability of a
podium finish for an individual driver. In addition to that, finding the optimal
training size (for example the previous 8 races). In prior analyses, overfitting
to the training set has been a common source of error. This is due to how quickly
the F1 teams can make significant adjustments to the cars. Many models will
struggle to adapt to these changes. By playing around with various training sizes,
identifying how long the data is still useful may become more apparent. The approach
here is of classification and supervised learning.

## Methods

<!--BOTH-->

Once the data has been gathered, we plan on applying synthetic minority
oversampling in order to balance the training set. The point of this is to improve
the balance in the training set since our binary classifier (Podium Finish or not)
naturally has many more observations in the non-podium class. From there, conducting
forward selection should be effective in finding the best features for the model.
That process would only include data from a specified number of prior races (n).
Then the predictions can be made on the (n + 1)th race. Lastly to optimize n, the
results can be aggregated over all subsets of n sequential races.
